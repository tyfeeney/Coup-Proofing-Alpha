    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p style = "text-align:left;">
      Welcome to the Coup-Proofing Game! In this game, you become an incumbent authoritarian dictator. Your goal is to coup-proof your regime.
    </p>
    <p style = "text-align:left;">
      You will be presented with different scenarios and two options to choose from. Select the option that you think will best help prevent a coup.
    </p>
    <p style = "text-align:left;">
      After selecting an option, the progress bars on the game will update. An explanation of the right decision will be provided immediately after your selection.
    </p>
    <p style = "text-align:left;">
      This game is timed, so you have 270 seconds to make all of your decisions. The game will end if your decisions are not made in this time. During explanations, the timer pauses.
    </p>
    <p style = "text-align:left;">
      The three progress bars, which determine the efficacy of your coup-proofing, are Officer Appointment, Economic Coup-Proofing, and Social Composition. 
      These factors, as well as the decisions, are based on the paper <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13629395.2014.932537">"Does Coup-Proofing Work?"</a> written by Holger Albrecht.
